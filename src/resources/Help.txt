This project consists of the development of a distributed program to control a simulated network of traffic lights.
The program has a graphical interface built from the Swing components, which consists of two different modules: a server and a client.
The server must coordinate and command the traffic lights (using a timed control), it must allow the user to monitor online how many traffic lights are active and which states are being controlled; when shutting down the server, all traffic lights must be closed
The client is basically a traffic light with conventional lights and must, when starting, send a registration message to the server; from there, you must receive the status commands (which light should be turned on) and present the respective graphical representation. If a traffic light (client module) is turned off, it must communicate this action to the server, so that the latter stops sending commands to it. There may be an arbitrary number of active clients on the network.
